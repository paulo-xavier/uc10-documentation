## What is a license? ‚ÅâÔ∏è

When we public a small code or a big project in our GitHub's repository, we can add some licenses or terms that will define what others can and can't do with our code. For example, somebody can clone your remote repository and use it for another project or something like that. If you are using a license, you can limit that. So, **a license works as a contract that add some usage rights to your source code**.
